# Task Efficient

## Task Efficient is a website used by employers to track their employees efficiency at work. When you open the app you will be prompted to select a task one at a time. Each task is given a certain amount of time that it should take to complete. After selecting your first task you will input the actual amount of time it took you to complete. You will then submit and your work efficiency will be shown in a table. After adding multiple completed tasks, your daily efficiency for the day will be shown. 


### What was our motivation?
Our motivation was to create an app that easily allows employers to track the efficiency of their employees. 

### Why did we build this project?
We built this project because it is a great way to keep track of your employees at the end of each work day. It gives your employees the freedom to keep themselves accountable during work hours, while not micro-managing them. As the employer you are able to see their efficiency at the end of each day. 

### What problem does it solve?
It solves the problem of employees slacking off or spending too much time on a certain task, because at the end of the day you will submit how long a task took you. 

### What did we learn?
We learned that this app is a great way for employers to see how their team is doing without checking on them multiple times throughout the day. 

### How to? 
When you arrive on the Task Efficient page you will choose a specific task from the "Please choose a Task" drop down tag, after chosen it will show up in the empty box next to the "Please choose a Task" box. You will then input the actual amount of time it took you in the "Actual Time" box and press "Submit". Then you will see your overall efficiency in the table created at the bottom of the page. The expected time will show up under the "Expected Task Time:". The efficiency of the chosen task will show up under the "Efficiency" colum. Your total efficiency will show up under the "Daily Efficiency" colum. When you've finished with everything you will press "Complete", a modal will show up and you will be prompted with directions to screenshot to send to your employee. If you run into hiccups, you can press the reset button below the "Actual Time" box and try again. You can also refresh your page on top of pressing the reset button. 


### Usage 
When you get to the Task Efficient page. You will choose the tasks you worked on that day one by one. After selecting your first task; example: Washing Dishes (10min) you will insert the amount of time it actually took you to complete. After submitting that you will be able to see your efficiency on a table. You will continue to do this with the rest of the tasks you completed that day. After doing all of that, you will submit one final time for the entire day and a congratulatory modal will show up on your screen.

### Directions for Future Development
Employers keeping themselves accountable as well as employees
changing the tasks as frequent as they want
